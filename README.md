# Code-refactor

## Refactoring an existing webpage for accessibility, semantics, and code readability

For this project, an existing webpage was refactored. Several goals were kept in mind during refactoring: improving code readability, improving webpage accessibility, ensuring that all HTML links work correctly, and adding semantic HTML tags.

### Accessibility Overview

In the past, it has been entirely possible to write webpages in HTML while using minimal amounts of semantic elements - by using mainly &lt;div&gt; tags, for example. However, semantic HTML elements not only impove accessibility for end-users, but they also improve code readability for developers. This can be especially important for more complex webpages, which could otherwise end up as a giant entanglement of &lt;div&gt; tags.
