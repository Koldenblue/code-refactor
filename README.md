# Code-refactor

## Refactoring an existing webpage for accessibility, semantics, and code readability

For this project, an existing webpage was refactored. Several goals were kept in mind during refactoring: improving code readability, improving webpage accessibility, ensuring that all HTML links work correctly, and adding semantic HTML tags.

### Accessibility Overview

In the past, it has been entirely possible to write webpages in HTML while using minimal amounts of semantic elements - by using mainly &lt;div&gt; tags, for example. However, semantic HTML elements have several uses. They improve website accessibility for end-users with screen readers. They can also improve search engine optimization by allowing easier parsing of the HTML. Furthermore, semantic elements improve code readability and ease of maintenance for developers. This can be especially important for more complex webpages, which could otherwise end up as a giant entanglement of &lt;div&gt; tags.

### Results

The code in this pre-existing webpage was refactored. Comments were added to denote any changes. The CSS stylesheet was made more succinct. Website accessibility and search engine optimization has also been improved. Links were checked for functionality. Semantic elements and alt text for images were implemented. Overall, the website code is cleaner, easier to read, and more accessible.
